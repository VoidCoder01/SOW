# Job Dashboard CI/CD Test Project

This is a simple project for testing CI/CD pipelines. It consists of an HTML dashboard and a Python script that renders data to it.

## 🌐 **Live Demo**

**🚀 Access your live dashboard:** [https://VoidCoder01.github.io/SOW](https://VoidCoder01.github.io/SOW)

*Note: The dashboard updates automatically every time you push to the main branch!*

## Files

- **`index.html`** - A responsive job dashboard template with modern styling
- **`render_data.py`** - Python script that generates sample job data and renders it to HTML
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies (currently empty as we only use standard library)
- **`README.md`** - This file

## How to Use

### 1. Run the Python Script

```bash
python render_data.py
```

This will:
- Generate 25 sample job listings
- Update the HTML file with real data
- Display statistics (total jobs, US jobs, remote jobs)
- Update the timestamp

### 2. View the Dashboard

Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the populated dashboard.

### 3. For CI/CD Testing

You can use this in your CI/CD pipeline to:
- Test Python script execution
- Verify HTML file generation
- Check data rendering functionality
- Validate file output

## Sample Output

The script generates realistic job data including:
- Job titles (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, etc.)
- Company names
- Locations (US cities + Remote options)
- Salary ranges
- Posted dates

## Customization

- Modify `generate_sample_jobs()` in `render_data.py` to change the data structure
- Update the HTML template in `index.html` to change the dashboard layout
- Add more statistics or job details as needed

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external packages required (uses only standard library)
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

This project includes comprehensive CI/CD configurations for multiple platforms:
